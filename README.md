# Deep-Learning-Easy-Learn
This repository is built to make learning ML and DL a lot of fun and basic mathematics. If you are weak in high school mathematics and geometry, then please sit down with your high school book. 
# How to explore this repository?
This space will provide you with mathematical knowledge most of the time instead of codes (will provide code **only where necessary**). First of all, you need to read the (.md) files starting from basic. Then the space will direct you where to go, and where you don't.
You can start by the introduction to Machine Learning from here: [Basic ML](https://github.com/Nasim-Ahmed71/Deep-Learning-Easy-Learn/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20ML/1.Basic%20ML/Basic_ML.md)
