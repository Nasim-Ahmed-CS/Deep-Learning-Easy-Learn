Let's start with an example:<html><br></html>
We have given some values of x (call them features) and some values of y<sub>actual</sub> (call them targets). Our job is to assume the values of y<sub>actual</sub> for unknown values of x. More simply, we need to find a **pattern**
Suppose, 
  >**x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]**<br>
and<br>
  >**y<sub>actual</sub> = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]**

We can easily find a pattern from here, as the values of y<sub>actual</sub> are the square of the values of x. Therefore, by doing this intuition, we can assume the new values of y<sub>actual</sub> for new values of x. For example, the value of y<sub>actual</sub> will be 100, when the value of x is 10.
