**What the hell is ML?**<br>
Before we move forward, first of all, we need to get familiar with the name ML. Yeah, just with the name. 
<br>
<p align='center'>ML is the short form of <b>"Solving Geometrical Problems".</p></b>

You don't need to.
Let us start with basic high school geometry.
Can you remember the equation of a straight line? 
<br>
It would be better if you could not...
<br>
Here it is,
<i><p align='center'>y = mx + b</p></i>
<br>
Here is the geometric picture:

<b>Do you know the meaning of all variables and constants present in this picture? Get ready for a Goosebump</b>
<br>
Let us categorize them as constants and variables-
<p align='center'><i>y = Constant</i><br>
<i>x = Constant</i><br>
<i>m = Variable</i><br>
<i>b = Variable</i><br></p>
<br>
Feeling awkward? If you cannot, please don't move forward. You need to run miles before.
