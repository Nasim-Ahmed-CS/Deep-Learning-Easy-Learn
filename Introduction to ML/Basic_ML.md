**What the hell is ML?**<br>
Before we move forward, first of all, we need to get familiar with the name ML. Yeah, just with the name. 
<br>
<p align='center'>ML is the short form of <b>"Solving Geometrical Problems".</p></b>

You don't need to.
Let us start with basic high school geometry.
Can you remember the equation of a straight line? 
<br>
It would be better if you could not...
<br>
Here it is,
<i><p align='center'>y = mx + b</p></i>
<br>
Here is the geometric picture:

<br>
<b>Do you know the meaning of all variables and constants present in this picture? Get ready for a Goosebump</b>
<br>
Let us categorize them as constants and variables-
<p align='center'><i>y = Constant</i><br>
<i>x = Constant</i><br>
<i>m = Variable</i><br>
<i>b = Variable</i><br></p>
<br>
Feeling awkward? If you cannot, please don't move forward. You need to run miles before.
<br>Ohhh! You are still here? Okay. Let's go...<br>
Basically, in machine learning, the values of <b><i>y</i></b> and <b><i>x</i></b> are given. That is, the values of features (x) and their corresponding targets (y) are given. If not, this is not machine learning.
<br>
So what? What should we do now? What should we do with <b><i>m and b</i></b> in the equation?<br>
<br>
<br>Most importantly <b>What the hell is this Machine Learning?</b>
Okay! Machine learning is to assume the best values of m and b so that the values of y (call it <b><i>y<sub>predicted</sub></i></b>) based on those values and x should fit with the actual values of y (call it <b><i>y<sub>actual</sub></i></b>).

<b><p align='center'>Can we recap all of this?</p></b>
What we will be given:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>y<sub>actual</sub></b> = The values for the actual targets
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>x</b> = The values for features
  </li>
</ul>
<br>

What we should calculate:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>y<sub>predicted</sub></b> = The values for the prediction of targets
  </li>
</ul>

<br>
What should we consider?
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>m</b> = Values of slope. (we will continuously update this until we reach the best fit for the <i>y<sub>predicted</sub></i> and <i>y<sub>actual</sub></i>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>b</b> = Values of y-intercept. (we will continuously update this until we reach the best fit for the <i>y<sub>predicted</sub></i> and <i>y<sub>actual</sub></i>
  
  </li>
</ul>
