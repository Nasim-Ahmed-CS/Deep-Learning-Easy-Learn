Our given data were as follows:<br>
<p align= 'center'><b>x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and <br>
y<sub>actual</sub> = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]<br>
  initially, m<sub>old</sub> = b<sub>old</sub> = 0
</b>
</p>
Now, for simplicity, let's consider only the first index, and we will show all steps by using this value only.
