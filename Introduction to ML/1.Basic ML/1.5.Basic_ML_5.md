<p>Here, in the graph, the red dots are marking the actual data points. The straight lines are drawn based on different values of $m$ and $b$ until we get our desired values of $m$ and $b$. Finally, we can see some straight lines which are very closed to the actual data points ($y_{\text{actual}}$). </p>
