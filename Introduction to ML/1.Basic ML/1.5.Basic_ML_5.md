# We are here after a ton of crisis
Let's look at a graph...

<p>Here, in the graph, the red dots are marking the actual data points. The straight lines are drawn based on different values of $m$ and $b$ until we get our desired values of $m$ and $b$. Finally, we can see some straight lines that are very close to the actual data points ($y_{\text{actual}}$). The values of the MSE for different straight lines are also different. The value of the $MSE$ for the straight lines is larger which is far from the actual data points.</p>
<p>Some people think of a single line for a dataset, but there could indeed be multiple best values of $m$ and $b$ for a particular dataset.</p>
<p>Okay. We have read a lot of stories. Can we move forward to some coding? Let's go...<a href='https://github.com/Nasim-Ahmed71/Deep-Learning-Easy-Learn/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20ML/1.Basic%20ML/1.6.Basic_ML_6.md'>Basic_ML6</a></p>
